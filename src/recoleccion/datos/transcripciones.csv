Regresando la Casa Blanca, tras derrotar al actual vicepresidenta Camala Harris con más de 270 votos, Wisconsin se dio el triunfo del republicano quien tiene así 277 votos electorales de acuerdo con la agencia a Societe Press. Harris en ese momento tenía 224, aunque quedan por definirse estados como Michigan, Nevada, Arizona y Alaska en todos ellos la tendencia favoreza Trump. En una contienda que dividió profundamente al país, el expresidente republicano, supera Harris en un enfrentamiento polarizado que reflejora atención política y social que ha caracterizado su carrera. Solictoria marcó el regreso de una figura controvertida que tras derrota en 2020 volvía movilizar a una base de votantes dispuestos a darle una nueva oportunidad para gobernar. Trump regresa acompañado por el triunfo de los republicanos en el Senado, donde tendrá mayoría. Está pendiente en recuento final de la cámara de representantes que por ahora favoreza los republicanos, 198 contra 180, la victoria de Trump tras derrotar en 2020 marcó un hit en la política estadounidense, con un regreso que ya está generando una gran expectación sobre cómo gobernará en un país más polarizado que nunca."

es," Malas noticias para los inmigrantes, estas son las reformas migratorias de Trump para Estados Unidos. Trump ha presentado una serie de medidas firmes para tratar la problemáticas de la inmigración. Una de las propuestas es deportación en masa destinada entre las 15 y 20 millones de inmigrantes sin documentos, a pesar de que el número preciso ha generado, controversia, el Pewri-Sech se antecalcula que la cantidad de inmigrantes sin documentos ascendía cerca de 11 millones en 2022, a pesar de estos números, Trump continúa sosteniendo la importancia de una intervención que en Cideréville, otro aspecto clave, de su política migratoria es la utilización de la Guardia Nacional y incluso del Ejército. En caso de ser necesario para llevar a cabo las deportaciones, Trump sostiene que no sería una infracción a las leyes que impiden la utilización militar contra civiles, sosteniendo que estos no son civiles. Son individuos que no se encuentran legalmente en nuestro país, es una invasión a nuestra nación. Pero en un giro inesperado, Trump ha propuesto otorgar de manera automática la tarjeta de residencia, a ciudadanos extranjeros que se graduen de universidades estadounidenses, la implementación de la ley de enemigos extranjeros y la opción de utilizar al Ejército para implementar, las normativas migratorias son dos de las acciones más polémicas. Estas propuestas no solo han susitado críticas por su radicalidad, sino que también generan insertidumbre. Acerca de su factibilidad legal y los gastos financieros que conllevarían. ¿Qué opinas?"

Think what that means. That is a vital, vital year of critical development of a child. And the cost can really add up, especially for young parents who need to buy diapers and clothes and a car seat and so much else. And we will do this while reducing the deficit. Compare my plan with what Donald Trump intends to do. He plans to give billionaires massive tax cuts year after year. And he plans to cut corporate taxes by over $1 trillion, even as they pull in record profits. And that's on top of the $2 trillion tax cut. He already signed into law when he was president, which by the way, overwhelmingly went to the wealthiest Americans in corporations and exploded the national deficit.

en," I have never seen the crowd at a Trump rally as confused and as bored as the crowd was last night during Donald Trump's Montana rally where his cognitive decline was on full display. Now you guys have probably noticed it as well but over these past two or three weeks, Donald Trump has become especially unhinged basically since the day that VP Harris took the mantle and began running. Donald Trump has been declining at the NABJ. He broke down on stage in front of some black journalists. A few days ago he held a press conference where he was whining the entire time and the cherry on top was this rally last night where I want you to watch his crowd throughout. I'll point it out, we can break down some of his racist attacks against VP Harris. His desperate struggle to find anything to attack VP Harris and Sam Waltson also, his obsession with attacking President Biden even though Biden isn't running. So in this first clip, Trump makes it very, very clear that he has nothing solid against VP Harris. He's genuinely destroying stuff at the wall and seeing what sticks. Notice how desperate he sounds during this... Well, she has a couple of things that a lot of people from Montana would like. Like, she wants to take away your guns. You like that, right? Oh, alright, how about this? She wants to defund the police. Are you okay with that? He is really losing his spark. Let me point out. I mean, in 2016 he did have a different level of energy than we see today on stage. He seems a lot more tired. He's slurring a lot more. He doesn't seem to have that oomph behind what he's saying. She wants to allow millions of people to pour into our border through an invasion using an invasion process. I don't think so. Using an invasion process. He also seems a lot more mad and angry. He seems like an old grandpa who's lecturing their grandkids rather than somebody who's giving a speech to his supporters. I don't think that's for you. It's not for me either. It's not for most people in this country. We're going to evict crazy Kamalad. We're going to... He has nothing. They're so desperate to find anything. Anything to attack VP Harrison because the reality is Kamala and Tim Walls are the normal people. I think the electorate is starting to notice that. And notice Donald Trump as the radical lunate who's slurring his way through speeches. And can't go one second without making some sort of racist or sexist remark. But in this next clip. This really highlights..."

But the happiest people tend to be the people that are making a nice income that really enjoy their life and their family life and not the people of tremendous wealth that are constantly driven to achieve more and more success. But when is enough enough? Obviously, there must have been a time of point when you knew that you would be secure for the rest of your life, your family, your relatives, whomever. Why do you go on? I go on really because I enjoy it. I really enjoy when I think about my business. I think about it literally 24 hours a day. And I really enjoy it. If I didn't, I will stop. There's no question in my mind that I'll stop. Because I do understand it's all basically a game. We're all here to play the game, and we're all hopefully going to play it well. But some people obviously can play it well because if everyone played it well, you'd have a pretty unusual situation. But the game is being played now by me and by plenty of other people.

es," La carrera presidencial de los Estados Unidos se puso súper interesante y es que desde que Camala Harris tomó el lugar de Joe Biden en la candidatura del Partido Democrata, las cosas se complicaron para donar Trump. De hecho, la mayoría de las encuestas apuntaban a que Trump regresaría a la Casa Blanca tras las elecciones de noviembre. Pero ¿qué creen? Y los republicanos magas no contaban con la estucia de Camala Harris. Con decirte que el cambio en el ambiente electoral de los Estados Unidos puede tal magnitud, que hasta las encuestas señalan que Camala ya le dio la vuelta a Trump en las preferencias electorales. Checa lo que dicen los agregadores para la presidencia de los Estados Unidos al 13 de agosto. Por ejemplo, Tenayos Times comparte un promedio de las encuestas nacionales y dice que Harry lidera las preferencias con 48% sobre un 47% de Trump. Por otro lado tenemos el promedio de encuestas de Real Clirpolitics. Ellos también ponen a Camala como la líder de las preferencias con un 47.6%. Mientras que Trump se mantiene pegado con un 47.1%. Por último tenemos el promedio de encuestas de Farty Reik, que teniendo en cuenta la actualidad de cada encuesta, en tamaño de la muestra, la metodología y los efectos de las camaras, Camala Harris también se encuentra sobre Trump en esta medición, con un 46% contra un 43%. Así que como puedes ver, la contienda en Estados Unidos va a estar más cerrada de lo que pensaban. Y el encuentro entre Camala Harris y Donald Trump dará mucho de que hablar. Obvio la información de todas las encuestas la podrás encontrar en Pulse Mesh."

en," I used to support Trump back in the day. I didn't really know anything about him. I just wanted to support him because all my other friends like Donald Trump. So I was like, okay, I'll like Donald Trump. Like it was like a band-marked thing. Now hear me out. Um, I know I look like a circus clown right now. Just just process. I went to a predominantly white high school middle school in elementary school. Like seeing a black person was like extremely rare at my school. Like there was no diversity. Okay. The coolest thing you could be like in my middle school and high school that I went to was literally a Republican, a conservative Republican at that. So why not follow the band-legged? And then everyone always used me as that one excuse. That one friend. If somebody was like, oh, like you're supporting Trump your racist. I'd be like, no, I'm not. I'm French and Julianne. Guilty. I literally looked so dumb. And I thought like finally all the white people at my school liked me. No. They didn't like me. They just liked that I liked what they liked. I didn't know Trump was bad until one time in my social studies class. We were watching the CNN news. Like it was like a 10 minute news thing. We were watching it. And afterwards I literally I clapped because Donald Trump was on the TV. I clapped. Nobody else even clapped. Like I was so pick me like choose me. Love me. If you couldn't fucking tell I wanted to fit in. So fucking bad. I think we've established that. So yeah, I clapped. So when I clapped, everybody looked at me and they were like, and I was like, whatever losers. No, I was the loser. I was the biggest loser of them all. So my friend comes up to me after class and she's like, why do you like Donald Trump? Like you're literally a minority. And I was like, cuz I love him. Because everybody else likes Donald Trump. Like why don't you like Donald Trump? Like what's the tea? So my girlfriend finally like explains to me how Trump is racist. He's a piece of shit. Like he's just a horrible person. And I was like, oh yeah, I didn't get that information. And of course I did it. Why would these white conservative Republican-ass people that I was friends with tell me all the like all the terrible things that he's done and the bad human being that he is. Why would they do that? You are who you're surround yourself with. And when I was younger, I surrounded myself with a bunch of Nimrods and idiot sandwiches. So I ended up like this. So once I found out he was a racist piece of shit, um, of course I stopped supporting him. And one of the most embarrassing things about supporting Trump was I literally used to have like a Trump sticker on my school laptop. And when I would come home, my mom would rip it off every time and I would really ask my conservative friends to give me more Trump stickers because my mom kept ripping it off. Like as she said, because we're immigrants. And like, I don't even know why like Trump because Trump didn't even like me, like especially me. It is with great pleasure that I announced that I obviously do not support him anymore. I haven't in like almost 10 years, like he's scary. I assume you realize the best thing you could do for yourself is to just form your own opinion. And also the best quality to have is being educated. Nobody likes a dumb bitch. It was me. I was a dumb bitch. Nobody liked me. This would be smart. Be educated. It's the sexiest thing a woman can be educated. Okay. Bye."

The more you walk away from things that poison your soul, the healthier your life will be. When people make you feel unwanted, don't leave to make them feel sad or guilty.

Now when I was a bell hop they paid me about 425 an hour but I made hundreds of dollars in cash tips which we didn't report obviously because they can tax it but everything's on credit cards now. You can't hide it. Uncle Sam tax his tips. Biden hired 87,000 extra IRS agents gave him guns to do it. Trump's tip tax cut makes Biden look like a sinister old geaser.

Dejón Trump se había acordado que dicho empresa financiera el concurso de belleza, sin embargo, como esto no sucedió, el magnate pidió como compensación que a Rosas-Moya le embargarán 26 propiedades en playa del Carmen, que habían sido puestas como garantía. Pero en principio el Tribunal concedió al expresidente de las propiedades, pero poco después, Rosas-Moya interpuso un amparo, ganó el caso y la recuperó. Así está derrota, fundó un golpe para Trump, por lo que muchos aseguran que contribuye al resentimiento que tienes a los mexicanos.

es," Váigas se retira y Camala Harry centra a la contienda. Pareciera una luz de esperanza contra las terroríicas propuestas racistas de Trump, pero ¿de verdad Harry no haría un gobierno racista? Después de canalizar miles de millones de dólares a una guerra indirecta en Ucrania y a un genocidio en Gaza, el partido democrata intenta salvar sus posibilidades de ganar las elecciones en noviembre de este año y su apuesta se llama Camala Harry. ¿Quién es ella en verdad? A simple vista podríamos ver a Harry como un perfil progresista, una mujer demócrata, hija de padres migrantes de India y Jamaica. Camala tuvo la intención de presentarse en 2020 a la presidencia de los Estados Unidos, pero las encuestas no la favorecian. Después de la asesinato de George Floyd, algunos demócratas y progresistas se solidarizaron con el movimiento antipolicial. Harry era conocida por sus políticas severas en California, políticas racistas que utilizaban la justicia selectivamente. Así se ganó su título de Camala de Cop, Camala policía, título que no brillaba entre la gente con una postura antipolicial. En resumen, su imagen no era lo que buscaba la población de centro derecha en 2020 y definitivamente no era lo que buscaban los demócratas en ese momento. Camala se repira de la contienda y fue elegida como vicepresidente por de dazo de Joe Biden. Durante su periodo, sus mayores esfuerzos giraron alrededor de detener la migración del sur global hacia Estados Unidos. Es importante mencionar que la mayor parte de la clase dominante y los grandes capíticas capitalistas de Estados Unidos no quieren al impredecible de Donald Trump y apoyan a Camala porque esta representa la estabilidad económica para ellos. Al ser Camala vicepresidenta su elección tiene tintes de una reelección y de continuidad. Así, Camala seguiría con el legado de Biden y un legado que no aprobó un solo proyecto de ley para mejorar la vida del pueblo estadounidense y un legado imperialista que ha dado forma al genocidio más grande del siglo XXI. Camala sigue siendo el rostro del imperialismo. Después de saber esto, con demócratas o republicanos, habrá forma de librarnos del racismo."

en," Amela Harris needs to run her election campaign like a Taylor Swift album release, and I'm being so serious. Step number one, she needs to delete her entire social media and unfollow everyone, blackout everything. Step number two, she starts posting a three-part series that is going to reveal an announcement and is three pieces of a coconut tree. Finally, the last post has the caption, there will be no coconut tree, just the context of all in which she lived and what came before you. Then, later this month, at the Democrat National Convention, they need to start playing a video of all the bad things Donald Trump has said about Kamala Harris. And it will sound exactly like the reputation stadium tour intro where slowly it says coconut tree, coconut tree, and it gets louder until that's all that it's saying. And then all the music cuts, and you hear, you think you just fell out of a coconut tree? Ha ha ha ha! And then it goes completely dark and black and you hear the beginning notes of ready for it. And that's how she makes her entrance. She comes on stage wearing coconut tree earrings and she steps up to the podium and delivers the speech of a lifetime. Then, throughout the rest of the campaign, they still need to continue this strategy. They need to leave Easter eggs. They need to get people clues about who the vice presidential pick is going to be. I want limited edition variants of all of her merch. I mean, seriously, who is better at pushing something to winning when the race is really close? They need to get tree pain on the case, stat."
en," I just want to run it back, though, to the very beginning, because this is something that I just can't get over. I can't get over the gentle lady from South Carolina talking about white privilege. It was a spin the face, at least of mine, as a black woman, for you to talk about what white privilege looks like, especially from that side of the aisle, and let me quote your now-austed speaker in what he had to say about the Republican party and y'all's lack of diversity. When you look at the Democrats, they actually look like America. When I look at my party, we look like the most restrictive country club in America. So let me tell you something. Y'all don't know what white privilege looks like, but I'm going to show you a little bit of something. You see, you want to talk about a two-tier justice system, and this is the only time the child have ever referenced it when this country has a history, when it comes to black and brown folk, of having two separate sets of rules. And right now, what you want to do is have two separate sets of rules, because Mr. Moscowitz offered a fair situation. He said he would vote for a hunter to be held in contempt if y'all voted to hold, even if you remove all of the members of Congress. There's still other people that y'all haven't decided that y'all have excuses for it, but y'all don't want to hold them in contempt. But for some reason, it makes sense to hold hunter Biden in contempt who is tried to comply. And let me tell you why nobody wants to talk to y'all behind closed doors, because y'all lie. That's just the bottom line. You have done it thus far in this investigation. You have done it this far as it relates to this committee and every single hearing, y'all spin, spin, spin. I don't know how y'all are still standing right now, because you should be quite dizzy from all the spending that you're constantly doing when it comes to spinning the truth. You talk about free and fair elections, but you back a guy who we know tried to steal the election. And this isn't about what Democrats have to say. Let me remind you for those of you that don't know how the justice system works. It's not a matter of the president went in and indicted Trump. But we are talking about grand juries. Grand juries are comprised of American citizens. And the people that have entered pleas of guilty that will be flipping on your leader in a minute, they are Republicans. I do want to point that out. And half of them were Republicans that were handpicked by Donald Trump himself. So to be clear, whatever happens to your little leader, it's going to be because of the actions that he took. So you can talk all you want to about how January 6 was nonsense, but all of y'all were running. At that time, y'all were grabbing y'all's gas masks, and y'all were running to your offices, because you didn't know if they were coming to kill you. You should have cared that somebody was there to protect you. But instead, you want to play games because you found out that it was your leader that decided that he wanted to propagate an insurrection on our country. So don't tell me that you care about the Constitution, because you don't. All you care about is Trump getting reelected and I'll yield the last of my time to my leader. Thank you."

It's just such a disgrace, I think, to our country that an American would give him any kind of platform to propaganda. Wait, if I may, I'm amazed at the level of self-projection going on here. I mean, Alicia, you work for ABC. Tucker works for himself. Objectively, you are a puppet and he's not. And, Sonny, you're basically saying that Tucker shouldn't be allowed to have a voice. That's the opposite of the democracy that you preach every time we're here. And finally, none of you had any examples on what Tucker had said that was a lie or propaganda.

en,I have never seen the crowd at a Trump rally as confused and as bored as the crowd was last night during Donald Trumps Montana rally where his cognitive decline was on full display Now you guys have probably noticed it as well but over these past two or three weeks Donald Trump has become especially unhinged basically since the day that Vp Harris took the mantle and began running Donald Trump has been declining at the Nabob He broke down on stage in front of some black journalists A few days ago he held a press conference where he was whining the entire time and the cherry on top was this rally last night where I want you to watch his crowd throughout I'll point it out we can break down some of his racist attacks against Vp Harris His desperate struggle to find anything to attack Vp Harris and Sam Watson also his obsession with attacking President Biden even though Biden isn't running So in this first clip Trump makes it very very clear that he has nothing solid against Vp Harris He's genuinely destroying stuff at the wall and seeing what sticks Notice how desperate he sounds during this of Well she has a couple of things that a lot of people from Montana would like Like she wants to take away your guns You like that right Oh alright how about this She wants to defend the police Are you okay with that He is really losing his spark Let me point out I means in of of he did have a different level of energy than we see today on stage He seems a lot more tired He's slurring a lot more He doesn't seem to have that oomph behind what he's saying She wants to allow millions of people to pour into our border through an invasion using an invasion process I don't think so Using an invasion process He also seems a lot more mad and angry He seems like an old grandpa who's lecturing their grand kids rather than somebody who's giving a speech to his supporters I don't think that's for you It's not for me either It's not for most people in this country We're going to evict crazy Kampala do We're going to of He has nothing They're so desperate to find anything Anything to attack Vp Harrison because the reality is Kampala and Tim Walls are the normal people I think the electorate is starting to notice that And notice Donald Trump as the radical lunar e who's slurring his way through speeches And can't go one second without making some sort of racist or sexist remarks But in this next clip This really highlights of

en,Amelia Harris needs to run her election campaign like a Taylor Swift album release and I'm being so serious Step number one she needs to delete her entire social media and un follow everyone blackout everything Step number two she starts posting a three part series that is going to reveal an announcement and is three pieces of a coconut tree Finally the last post has the caption there will be no coconut tree just the context of all in which she lived and what came before you Then later this months at the Democrat National Convention they need to start playing a video of all the bad things Donald Trump has said about Kampala Harris And it will sound exactly like the reputation stadium tour intro where slowly it says coconut tree coconut tree and it gets louder until that's all that it's saying And then all the music cuts and you heart you think you just fell out of a coconut tree Ha ha ha had And then it goes completely dark and black and you hear the beginning notes of ready for it And that's how she makes her entrance She comes on stage wearing coconut tree earrings and she steps up to the podium and delivers the speech of a lifetime Then throughout the rest of the campaign they still need to continue this strategy They need to leave Easter eggs They need to get people clues about who the vice presidential pick is going to be I want limited edition variants of all of her march I means seriously who is better at pushing something to winning when the race is really close They need to get tree pain on the case state
en,I just want to run it back though to the very beginning because this is something that I just can't get over I can't get over the gentle lady from South Carolina talking about white privilege It was a spin the face at least of mine as a black woman for you to talk about what white privilege looks like especially from that side of the aisle and let me quote your now used speaker in what he had to say about the Republican party and y'all lack of diversity When you look at the Democrats they actually look like American When I look at my party we look like the most restrictive country club in American So let me tell you something Y'all don't know what white privilege looks like but I'm going to show you a little bit of something You see you want to talk about a two tier justice system and this is the only time the child have ever referenced it when this country has a history when it comes to black and brown folk of having two separate sets of rules And right now what you want to do is have two separate sets of rules because Mr Moscow it z offered a fair situation He said he would vote for a hunter to be held in contempt if y'all voted to hold even if you remove all of the members of Congress There's still other people that y'all haven't decided that y'all have excuses for it but y'all don't want to hold them in contempt But for some reason it makes sense to hold hunter Biden in contempt who is tried to comply And let me tell you why nobody wants to talk to y'all behind closed doors because y'all lies That's just the bottom line You have done it thus far in this investigation You have done it this far as it relates to this committee and every single hearing y'all spin spin spin I don't know how y'all are still standing right now because you should be quite dizzy from all the spending that you're constantly doing when it comes to spinning the truth You talk about free and fair elections but you back a guy who we know tried to steal the election And this isn't about what Democrats have to say Let me remind you for those of you that don't know how the justice system works It's not a matter of the president went in and indicted Trump But we are talking about grand juries Grand juries are comprised of American citizens And the people that have entered pleas of guilty that will be flipping on your leader in a minutes they are Republicans I do want to point that out And half of them were Republicans that were handpicked by Donald Trump himself So to be clear whatever happens to your little leaders it's going to be because of the actions that he took So you can talk all you want to about how January a was nonsense but all of y'all were running At that time y'all were grabbing y'all gas masks and y'all were running to your offices because you didn't know if they were coming to kill you You should have cared that somebody was there to protect you But instead you want to play games because you found out that it was your leader that decided that he wanted to propagate an insurrection on our country So don't tell me that you care about the Constitution because you don't All you care about is Trump getting reelected and I'll yield the last of my time to my leaders Thank you

en,Like he used him as his puppet and it exposed what many of us have been saying about Tucker Carlson He's a Kremlin puppet who doesn't know what the hell he's talking about It's just such a disgrace I think to our country that an American would give him any kind of platform to propaganda Wait if I may I'm amazed at the level of self projection going on here I means Alicia you work for Abc Tucker works for himself Objectively you are a puppet and he's not And Sonny you're basically saying that Tucker shouldn't be allowed to have a voice That's the opposite of the democracy that you preach every time we're here And finally none of you had any examples on what Tucker had said that was a lie or propaganda But I'm too nice so I will give you another chance Give me some specific examples to back your claims Let's god
